### About Tic tac toe
 It is a game played by two players where they choose random numbers between 1 to 9. The first player takes X and the second player takes O. The first player who matches three spots in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. When the spots on the board are all marked with no matches, then, the game ends in a draw.

### Game rules
- Player 1 plays with "x"
- Player 2 plays with "0"
- The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner!
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
